Did you forget?
Do it for life
Chicago that time
All bull-- aside
Wonderful vibe
Wonderful night
Did it with Trav
All the kids, you and I
Off in this club
Bumpin and grindin
Who made it flood
You see the signs (signs)
We pulled out the feathers for this type of weather
She pulled to club, to buss up a dub
She came with her man, I called in a sub
She givin' out hugs, we know 'bout them hugs
She put in my hand, don't know what it was
She know some of the fam, but don't know enough
My trust is In God We Trust
Sippin' on wok, don't do tuss
She got her own fans, she need her a bus
Might give her a chance, it's givin' her
Out in a trance it's givin' her
Not on them Xans is givin her
-- with bands is givin her
A -- with plans is givin her
Still in the gym, ain't did the implants
I like that for real, ain't givin up
Like they know that you real, they give it up
Like if you got the steel, they give it up
Takin these M's they givin us
Then run in the field like it's ten of us
I'm cleanin -- out like an enema
I make that -- look like a cinema

Take off the top, baby let's ride
I'm with my dogs, I picked a side
She want the boss, the one own the tribe
(I own the tribe yeah)
Arm out the window just throw it when we ride
I bent the corner scraped the wheels and the tires
Put twenty hoes on a boat til they tired
Everybody on
You now you need me my --, just keep the -- real
Don't you crab with your song
Who else -- up the city like us?
When it rains, it's a thunderstorm
I party at Shabba, in New York and LA
Where they keep on going till the dawn (shabba)
$200k what I'm on
She licking all down my chest
I told her I aint slime bae call me sex
It ain't no dope where I put these racks at
If you my hoe I call you sexy
Got LA -- so bad it's dangerous
I backed out of the knot, she tried to tangle up
She got Paris manners and they so dangerous
